Here's my blog about Python:

First here's how R and Python interact with reticulate().

```{r}
#R CHUNK
UT <- "hook"
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}
#PYTHON CHUNK
y = "'em"
print(r.UT,y)
```

```{R}
#R again
cat(c(UT,py$y))
```

Now, I will look at how to do Strings in Python for fun: 


```{python}
'I am a Senior at UT'
'I' 'am' 'a' 'Senior''at' 'UT'
'\'I am a Senior at UT\''
```
or 

```{python}
who = "I "
what = "am a Senior"
where = " at UT"

who+what+where
```

More examples using String:

My favorite movie is Lilo & Stitch, so I'm going to make a string with a collection of my favorite lines from the movie and replace punctuation marks with 'aloha'.
```{python}
import re
strings=r"My name, Stitch. This is my family. I found it, all on my own. It's little, and broken, but still good. Yeah. Still good. My friends need to be punished. Also cute and fluffy! Nobody gets left behind. I like fluffy! Be carefull with the little angel!"

re.sub("[.,!,']",'ALOHA', strings)
```

Spliting my favorite quotes from the movie:
```{python}

strings1=re.sub("[.,!']",' ALOHA', strings)
re.split("\\s+", strings1)

```

"I like fluffy" ~ Stitch
